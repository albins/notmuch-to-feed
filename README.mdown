This is (for now) a rather simple hack to make an RSS feed from this
week's mail tagged with »rek« in
[notmuch](http://notmuchmail.org/). It's somewhat
[feed2imap](http://home.gna.org/feed2imap/)-centered, since that's
what I use, and many cleanup hacks for the incoming mail is based on
what feed2imap yields.

Also, I'm not really a python wizard, so improvement suggestions are
much welcome and needed.

Python libraries used
=====================
* python-json
* PyRSS2Gen
